# Bears_image_segmentation_and_aggressive_bears_classification
This project first develops a Bear vs. Non-Bear classifier, then uses the YOLO V8 model to segment the bear, and finally applies transfer learning to classify the filtered bear as either ‘Aggressive’ or ‘Normal’, based on zoological knowledge. The top-performing model achieved an F1-score of 0.91, a recall of 0.83, and a precision of 1.
